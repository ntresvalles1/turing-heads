`wp-now` is a CLI tool that allows you to quickly spin up a WordPress site with a single command. Similarly to the VS Code extension, it uses a portable WebAssembly version of PHP and SQLite. No Docker, MySQL, or Apache is required.

To install `wp-now` directly from `npm`:

```bash
npm install -g @wp-now/wp-now
cd wordpress-plugin-or-theme
wp-now start
```
