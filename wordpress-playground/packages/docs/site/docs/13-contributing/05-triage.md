# Triaging issues

You may help sort through WordPress Playground issues and determine their priority. Here's how:

1. Go to the [WordPress Playground](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues) repo on GitHub.
2. Click on the "Issues" tab to view the list of open issues.
3. Review the list of issues and look for ones that you can help with.
4. Once you've found an issue that you want to help with, read through the description and any comments to get a better understanding of the problem.
5. If you're able to reproduce the issue, add a comment to the issue with steps to reproduce it. This will help the developers to better understand the problem and come up with a solution.
6. If you're not able to reproduce the issue, add a comment to the issue with any additional information that you think might be helpful. This will help the developers to better understand the problem and come up with a solution.
