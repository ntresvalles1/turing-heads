# Contributing Documentation

WordPress Playground is documented by volunteers and we welcome your contributions.

The [documentation tracking issue](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues/217) contains a list of all documentation-related issues. It’s a good starting point to see what’s missing and what’s already there.

Anything that you were missing when exploring Playground for the first time is a great addition to the documentation, even if it requires a fundamental change in how the documentation speaks to the user.

## How can I contribute?

### I am familiar with Markdown

If you are familiar with Markdown, you can contribute directly to the documentation by submitting a pull request.

The current documentation is stored in the repo as Markdown files:

https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/tree/trunk/pages

Then, it’s deployed here:

https://wordpress.github.io/wordpress-playground

### I am not familiar with Markdown

If you are not familiar with Markdown, you can contribute by [opening an issue in the project repository](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues/new) and describing what you would like to see added or changed.

You could even write the content in the issue description and the project contributors will take care of the rest.

## What to contribute?

Documenting WordPress Playground, broadly speaking, consists of:

-   End-user documentation – What Playground is and isn’t, the limitations, how to use it etc
-   Developer documentation – How to build software with WordPress Playground?
-   Contributor documentation – How to contribute to WordPress Playground?
-   Ecosystem documentation – Related projects, tools, and resources. For example, VS Code extension, GitHub Actions, etc
